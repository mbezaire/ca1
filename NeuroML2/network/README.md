### NeuroML2 networks

**These networks have been generated by libNeuroML, pyNeuroML and OpenCortex.**

To be able to rebuild the networks from scratch install [OpenCortex](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OpenCortex) and run:

    cd ca1/NeuroML2/network
    python GenerateHippocampalNet_oc.py 100000  # builds a scaled down (to 100000) network

You can also build a network based on the saved .dat files by NEURON (see more in [results/](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1/tree/development/results/MiniScale_TestRun)) by running:

    python GenerateHippocampalNet.py "MiniScale_TestRun"
    
or just skip the steps above and use the provided example (also scaled down to 100000) and run:

    jnml LEMS_HippocampalNetwork_scale100000_oc.xml -neuron -run  # run with NERUON (you will need NEURON installed) 
    
Want to run parallel? NetPyNE is a NeuroML friendly NEURON parallelization package which does the work under the hood.
You just have to install [NetPyNE](https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne) and run:

    jnml LEMS_HippocampalNetwork_scale100000_oc.xml -netpyne -np -4  # will run on 4 cores
    
To run the simplified PING network (only PCs and BCs), run:

    python GeneratePINGNet_oc.py True  # run with NEURON
